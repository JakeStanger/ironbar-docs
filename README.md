# Ironbar Docs

This is the project for the [ironbar](https://ironb.ar) documentation side, 
hosted at <https://docs.ironb.ar>.

The site uses Astro and the Starlight documentation framework. 
Documentation is pulled from the `docs` folder in the main repo, hydrated and fed type information from the published Ironbar JSON schema.

Currently the schema and Corn language highlighting are checked into the repo.
Future versions will pull these in automatically via HTTP or as submodules.
